# After Action Review

Continuous improvement log. Each session ends with a brief review: what went well, what didn't, what to change. This is the POOGI (Process Of Ongoing Improvement) record for this project.

## 2026-06-23 — Initial session: bug fixes, CLAUDE.md, roadmap

**What went well:**
- Bug identification was sharp: caught the `FileNotFoundError` fallback failure and the `san`/`sanitize` tool confusion as distinct issues
- `dev/roadmap.md` came out well-structured — concrete CLI examples, rationale per feature, three clear tiers
- CLAUDE.md captured non-obvious things (GraphQL field names, exit codes, `sentences` not `sentence`) that save real time next session

**What didn't go well:**
- When fixing `san` → `sanitize`, updated three files but missed the Architecture section in CLAUDE.md — caught only at close
- Should have questioned the binary name earlier: the README linked to a repo called "sanitize" but the code called `san`; both were there to read from the start

**What we'll do differently:**
- Before editing a fact that appears in multiple files, grep for all occurrences first
- When a README references an external tool, verify the binary name matches the repo/description before writing it into code

## 2026-06-29 — --list/--last/--help, 1.0.0 release

**What went well:**
- Clarifying questions before implementation caught all the edge cases (optional `--list N`, default help, `--last` vs old implicit default)
- `parse_args` refactor to return `mode` was clean — `main()` dispatch is easy to follow
- Smoke-testing the parser inline before touching the API saved a round-trip
- `.env` / export debugging was methodical: traced shell → bashrc → env → os.environ in one pass
- Caught the README being stale before pushing to GitHub; `.gitignore` added proactively

**What didn't go well:**
- `~/.env` missing `export` keyword caused confusing "key not set" errors even though `echo $VAR` showed the value — took a few exchanges to land on `export | grep` as the diagnostic
- Edit tool rejected a no-op change (README URL was already correct) — small friction but harmless

**What we'll do differently:**
- When diagnosing "env var not found" in a subprocess, go straight to `export | grep VAR` rather than checking sourcing chain first

## 2026-06-29 — Unix citizenship: --stdout, -o, atomic writes, SIGPIPE, tab-separated --list

**What went well:**
- "Unix citizenship" framing produced a clean, prioritized list without scope creep
- All six changes landed in a single commit with no rework
- Smoke-testing `parse_args` inline caught the `--stdout`-alone edge case before it could cause confusion
- Atomic write pattern (`mkstemp` + `rename`) added real robustness with minimal code

**What didn't go well:**
- CLAUDE.md wasn't updated alongside the code changes — caught only at close, same pattern as session 1
- Roadmap `--stdout` entry wasn't ticked until close

**What we'll do differently:**
- After any feature commit, immediately check CLAUDE.md and roadmap for stale entries before moving on
